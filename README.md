# simon-game
This project is a web-based version of the classic Simon game, where the player needs to remember and repeat a sequence of colors. The game gets progressively harder as the player advances to higher levels. The game is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with jQuery for handling DOM manipulations and event listeners.
